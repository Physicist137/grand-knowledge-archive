TODO: Passive filters: RC, RL, LC, RLC.
TODO: High pass, Low pass, Band pass, Band stop.
TODO: First, Second, Third, Nth order filtersd.

TODO: Linkwitz-Riley Filter

TODO: Image Impedance Filter. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_image_filter
TODO: k-filter. m-filter. Etc.



TODO: Using ressonance and thevenin to increase voltage (just an idea) (do all necessary calculations).


MAYBE THIS IS POWER ELECTRONICS:
	TODO: Passive integrators, differentiators (Using capacitors)
	TODO: Magnetic mixers... etc.
	TODO: Laplace transform. Transfer functions (that will require calc 01 and complex 01 (to do this?))


WARNING: No op-amps allowed. Op-amped circuits shall go to Analog Electronics.
