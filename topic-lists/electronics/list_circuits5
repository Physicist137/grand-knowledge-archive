	- Pre-requisitive: Circuits 03, Calculus 01.
	- Co-requisitive: None


TODO: Ficticious component D, st: i_D = a * exp(b*v_D); (note: has active and passive regions). 
TODO: Model of a diode. Analysing circuits with diodes and resistors and sources.
TODO: Diodes, resistors, capacitors, inductors. Example: Retification.


-----------------
TODO: Little bit of intr of basic semiconductor physics.

TODO: Model of a diode
TODO: Diode Cascade. Voltage multiplier.

TODO: Model of a transistor
TODO: Amplification using a transistor.


TO CONSIDER: Remove this.
	- This is not circuits. Its just electronic components.
	- To perhaps make a new course for electronic components


ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS:
	- Solid State: Diode, Zener Diode, Transistor, FET, MOSFET, etc etc.
	- Valve: Electronic Valve, Diode Valve, Triode, Pentrode, etc, etc.
