Divisibility
	- Definition. a|b.
	- Fundamental Propositions
		- Proposition: a|b and b|c, then a|c (transitivity)
		- Proposition: a|b  ==>  ca|cb
		- Proposition: a|b and a|c, then a|(bx+cy).
		- Proposition: a|1	==> a = +- 1.
	- Theorem: The division algorithm.
		- For all a,b, thre exists q,r, st, a = b*q + r, with 0 <= r < b.
		- Proof: Let S = {a-bx : x\in Z st a-bx >= 0}, then S is non-empty.
		- Proof: There exists minimum. r=min{S} and q is the associated x-value of r.
		- Proof: r are within range 0 <= r < b.
		- Proof: r,q are unique.
	- The euclidean algorithm: Calculating gcd.
		- Description of the euclidean algorithm.
			- Divide r_{n-1} by r_n. Get: q_{n+1}, r_{n+1}.
			- In which: r_1 = a, r_0 = b.
		- Example.
			- Divide a,b. Get q,r.
			- Divide b,r. Get q2,r2.
			- Divide r,r2. Get: q3,r3.
			- Divide r2,r3. Get q4,r4.
			- And so on.
		- Proof of termination.
			- Truncation and well ordering principle.
			- r_N = 0. And, r_{N-1} = gcd(a,b).
		- Proof of correctness: gcd.
			- Proof: It is a common divisor: r_{N-1} | a and r_{N-1} | b.
			- Proof: It is the greatest one.
	- Extended euclidean Algorithm.
		- Claim: There exists integers a,b st ax + by = gcd(a, b).
