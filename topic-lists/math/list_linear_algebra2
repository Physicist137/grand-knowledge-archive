		- Proof: Soma de ideais eh ideal.
		- Example: M = dF[x], d polynomial in F, is an ideal.
		- Formal Definition: Ideal generated by polynomial
		- Proof: If M ideal, if 1 is M, then M = F[x].

	- Polynomial Ideal Theorems
		- Theorem: Every ideal can be generated by unique unitary polynomial.
			- Proof: Every ideal can be generated by polynomial (Take unitary least degree within ideal)
			- Proof: This polynomial is unique
		- Theorem: If p1..pn polynomials over F, not all null, then exists unique unitary polynomial d:
			- 1) d is in (p1, ..., pn).
			- 2) d|p1, d|p2, ..., d|pn.
			- 3) 1 and 2 ==> d divisible by any common divisor of pi.
		- Formal Definition: Greatest Common Divisor (gcd) of polynomials p1, ..., pn.
		- Note that: (p1, ..., pn) = (gcd(p1, ..., pn)). Thus notation (..) makes sense for gcd(..).
		- Formal Definition: p1, ..., pn relatively prime (or coprime) iff gcd(p1, ..., pn) = 1.
		- Example: gcd(2x5 - x3 - 3x2 - 6x + 4x, x4 - x2 - 2x - 2).
