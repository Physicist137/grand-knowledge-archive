Title: Elementary Algebra 02: 
	- Pre-requisitives: Elementary Algebra 01
	- Co-requisitives: Calculus 00, Complex 01.


TODO: Cubic Equation
	- Depressed Cubic. Conversion to depressed quartic.
	- Trigonometric Solution. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_function#Trigonometric_solution_for_three_real_roots
	- Hyperbolic Solution
	- Lagrange Method of roots
	- Trigonometric Solution (all three roots).
TODO: Quartic Equation?
	- Depressed quartic. Conversion to depressed quartic.
	- 
TODO: Resolver infinity coisas: sqrt(1 + sqrt(1 + sqrt(1 + ...))) = ??
TODO: Continued Fractions
TODO: Engel Expansion
TODO: Pierce Expansion.
TODO: Lambert W-Function. Its complex def as well.





The End!
Now you can go to:
	- Calculus: Integrais e aplicações
	- Complex Algebra (needs little bit more pre-requisitives)
