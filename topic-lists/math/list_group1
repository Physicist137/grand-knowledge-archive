		- Proposition: For each element in a group, its inverse is unique.
		- Proposition: If a,b elements of a group, then inv(ab) = inv(b) * inv(a).
		- Proposition: If a is element of a group, then inv(inv(a)) = a.
	- Basic equation solving propositions.
		- Proposition: Left Cancelation Law: if a,b,c in the group: ac = bc ==> a=b.
		- Proposition: Right Cancelation Law: if a,b,c in the group: ca = cb ==> a=b.
		- Proposition: Left Equation Imply: if a,b,c in the group: a=b ==> ac=bc.
		- Proposition: Left Equation Imply: if a,b,c in the group: a=b ==> ca=cb.

--------------------------
I was checking up cancelation law in groups. I found three questions of this in math SE, these ones: [Q1](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1666880/how-to-prove-b-c-if-ab-ac-cancellation-law-in-groups), [Q2](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1301324/proof-of-the-right-and-left-cancellation-laws-for-groups), and [Q3](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/673485/cancellation-property-in-groups). I was puzzled by one thing. [Accepted answer on Q1](http://math.stackexchange.com/a/1666905/169193) proved $ac = bc \implies a = b$ by assuming the very opposite of what he wanted to prove: $ac = bc \impliedby a = b$. Is that allowed?? Basically, they proved:
$$
\left(ac = bc \quad\impliedby\quad a = b\right)\quad\implies\quad
\left(ac = bc \quad\implies\quad a = b\right)
$$

Also, [accepted answer in Q2](http://math.stackexchange.com/a/1301326/169193) and the [other answer](http://math.stackexchange.com/a/1301327/169193) also assumed the same thing. For sake of shorter argument, consider:
$$
(1)\quad ac = bc \quad\impliedby\quad a = b\\
(2)\quad ac = bc \quad\implies\quad a = b
$$


Then I found Q3. All answers in Q3 do not assume such thing. I mean, take [this answer in Q3](http://math.stackexchange.com/a/673508/169193). He proves $(1)$ without use of $(2)$. Furthemore, from his proof of $(2)$, one can easily prove $(1)$.

Is it correct to prove $(2)$ considering $(1)$? If yes, why?
