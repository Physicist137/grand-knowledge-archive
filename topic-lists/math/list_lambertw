Trivial Equations
Properties of W Function
Some non-trivial Equations
Logarithm Equations
Equations involved W itself. x = W(x), etc.  E.g.: x = W(a/x) ==> x = W(sqrt(a)/2

Trivial Examples
x * e^x = a
bx * e^x = a
x * e^(cx) = a
bx * e^(cx) = a


Examples:
x^2 e^x = a
x^n e^x = a
x * e^x^2 = a
x * e^x^n = a
x^n * e^x^m = a

Nice ones:
x * (logx)^a - 2^(2t) = 0, x>1. ==> x = exp(a * W(a))
x = 1 - e^(a*x) ==> x = 0.
x*e^x + a*(e^x-1) = 0 ==> x = 0.
x^x^a = b
x^x = a
