There is an alternative way:
$$
\int_0^\infty\frac{e^x - 1}{xe^x(e^x+1)}dx = 
\int_0^\infty\frac{\tanh(x/2)}{xe^x}dx = 
\int_0^\infty\frac{1}{x}e^{-x}\tanh\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)dx = 
$$

Which we can invoke laplace transform:
$$
\mathcal{L}\left\{\frac{g(x)}{x}\right\}(s) = \int_s^\infty \mathcal{L}\left\{g(x)\right\}(s)ds = \int_0^\infty\frac{g(x)}{x}e^{-sx}dx\\
\int_0^\infty\frac{1}{x}e^{-x}\tanh\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)dx = 
\int_1^\infty\mathcal{L}\left\{\tanh\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\right\}(s)ds
$$

Of course,
$$
\mathcal{L}\left\{\tanh\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\right\}(s) = 
\int_0^\infty\tanh\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)e^{-sx}dx = 
\int_0^1\frac{1-x}{1+x} x^{s-1}dx = 
\int_0^1\left[\frac{x^{s-1}}{1+x}-\frac{x^s}{1+x}\right]dx
$$

Now we can factor out the polynomal:
$$
(1+x)(x^{s-1} - x^{s-2} + x^{s-3} + \cdots) = x^s + 1 \quad\implies\quad
\frac{x^s}{1+x} = \frac{1}{1+x}+\sum_{n=0}^{s-1}(-1)^{n+s} x^n
$$

That is,
$$
\int_0^1\left[\frac{x^{s-1}}{1+x}-\frac{x^s}{1+x}\right]dx = 
\int_0^1\left[\frac{1}{1+x}+\sum_{n=0}^{s-2}(-1)^{n+s-1} x^n
- \frac{1}{1+x}-\sum_{n=0}^{s-1}(-1)^{n+s} x^n\right] \\
\int_0^1\left[\sum_{n=0}^{s-2}(-1)^{n+s-1} x^n - \sum_{n=0}^{s-1}(-1)^{n+s} x^n\right] = 
\int_0^1\left[\sum_{n=0}^{s-2}(-1)^{n+s-1} x^n - \sum_{n=0}^{s-2}(-1)^{n+s} x^n - x^{s-1}\right]\\
\int_0^1\left[\sum_{n=0}^{s-2}\left((-1)^{n+s-1} + (-1)^{n+s}\right) x^n - x^{s-1}\right] = 
\int_0^1 x^{s-1}dx = \left[\frac{1}{s}x^s\right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{s}
$$

Then, the integral we want evaluates to:
$$
\int_0^\infty\frac{1}{x}e^{-x}\tanh\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)dx = 
\int_1^\infty\int_0^1\frac{1-x}{1+x} x^{s-1}dxds = 
\int_1^\infty\frac{1}{s}ds = 
\left[\frac{-1}{s^2}\right]_1^\infty = 1
$$
