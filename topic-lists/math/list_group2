		- Def: Center of the group
		- Def: Central (the elements of the center)
		- Note: Its the centralizer of the group itself.
		- Note: Central elements are "abelian" elements.
		- Question: Who is the center of an abelian group?
	- Properties of the center

Group Acting on Sets
	- Formal Definition: Left action of G on X
		- Mapping G x X --> X, (g, x) --> x.
		- Condition 01: ex = x.
		- Condition 02: (g1g2)x = g1(g2x).
		- Def: G-Set.
	- Examples
		- GL(n, R) acting on R^n with left matrix multiplication.
		- D4 acting on X = {1, 2, 3, 4} vertices of square. Action on X as functions.
		- A group acting on itself, (g, x) --> gx.
		- A group acting on itself by conjugation.
		- Trivial action of a group under itself.
	- Note: Can we see every g\in G as a function? g: X --> X.
		- Proposition: If G acts on X, g element of G, function g: X --> X, x --> g(x) is bijection.
		- Proposition: There exists homomorphism from G to the symmetry group of X, S_X.
		- Definition: If such homomorphism is injective: G acts faithfully on X.
		- Conclusion: We can.
	- Example: Z2 = {e, h} acting on regular hexagon X = {1,2,3,4,5,6}, where h acts as reflection
		- Show: The homomorphism Z2 --> S_X.
		- Note: The homomorphism is injective.
		- Note: Z2 acts faifully over regular hexagon.
		- Note: Z2 can be identified with subgroup of D6 (symmetry group of hexagon).
	- Example: Z3 = {e, g, g2} faithully action over cube
		- Show: The homomorphism. Show it is injective.
		- Note: Z2 acts faifully over cube.
		- Note: Z2 can be identified with subgroup of symmetry group of cube.


Orbit and Stabilizer
	- Subgroups of acting sets.
		- Def: Estabilizador: Stab_G(x)  or  G_x.
		- Def: Fixador. Fix_G(T)  or  G_T, T\subset X.
		- Proposition: The stabilizer of x is subgroup of G.
		- Proposition: The fixator of T\subset X is subgroup of G.
		- Proposition: The fixator is intersection for all x\in T for stabilizer of x.
		- Note: Not necessarily stabilizer is normal subgroup. Can we prove it?
	- Orbit and G-Equivalence.
		- Def: Orbit
		- Def: G-Equivalence.
		- Proof: G-Equivalence is an equivalence relation
		- Note: Orbit of X under G: Partitions of the equivalence relation.
		- Note: Orbit of x under G: The equivalent classes of the relation.
		- Writing the orbit in the langauge of set (the two ways).
		- Note: The element x is always on its orbit.
		- Notation: Orb_G(x)  or  G(x)  or  G.x,  x\in X.
	- Example: Z2 = {e, h} acting on regular hexagon X = {1,2,3,4,5,6}, where h acts as reflection
		- Calc: The orbit of each element of X.
		- Note: The orbits is indeed a partition of X.
		- Calc: The relation of each element of X.
	- Example: special orthogonal group acting on R2.	
		- Calc: The orbit of element of R2 acted by SO(2).
		- Calc: The stabilizer of SO(2) acting on R2 on any nonzero element of R2.
		- Calc: The stabilizer of SO(2) acting on R2 on the zero element of R2.
	- Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem
		- Enunciation: G acts in X. Then, for each x\in X, [G:Stab_G(x)] = |Orb_G(x)|.
		- Recall: [G:Stab_G(x)] is the amount of left cosets of the stabilizer.
		- Note: Using the most natural function. What appens with it? How to fix?
		- Note: To fix, use phi(Hg) = g^(-1)(x).
		- Note: Not necessarily the domain is a group. Its just set of left cosets.
		- Note: Furthermore, the codomain of such function is not a group...
		- Corolary: If G is finite acts on X, then for each x\in X: |G| = |Stab_G(x)||Orb_G(x)|.
	- Examples of using such theorem
		- Example: Calculate the number of all proper rotations of a cube.
		- Example: Calculate the number of all proper and improper rotations of a cube.
	- Proposition: G acts on G by conjugation. Let x\in G. Then, are equivalent:
		- 1) x is in the center.
		- 2) Stab_G(x) = G.
		- 3) Orb_G(x) = {x}.
		- 4) |Orb_G(x)| = 1.
	- The Class Equation. Finite group acting on itself by conjugation
		- Recall: The orbits partition the group G.
		- Note: G is disjoint union.
		- Note: If exists, we can separate orbit {x} into center.
		- Note: G is disjoinnt union of center and disjoint union of nontrivial orbits.
		- The class equation
	- The Cauchy Theorem.
		- Enunciation: Let G group, and prime p divides order of G. Then G has element of order p.
		- Proof by induction: Theorem is true for all groups of order less than |G|.
		- Proof for abelian groups.
		- Proof for nonabelian groups.
		- Proof on the start of induction: |G| = p.
		- Proof: Using Class Equation.
	- Corolaries of Cauchy Theorem
		- Corolary: If |G| = p^n, p prime, n natural, then Z(G) is nontrivial.
		- Corolary: If |G| = p^2, p prime, then G is abelian.

---------------------------------------
Let $X$ finite set. Define $F$ as a set of some functions $f: X\mapsto X$. 

Let $x\in X$. Now define the following sets:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& A(x) = \{f(x) : f\in F\} \\
& B(x) = \{y\in X : y = f(x), \forall f\in F\} \\
& C(x) = \{y\in X : y = f(x), \mbox{ for some } f\in F\} \\
& D(x) = \{y\in X : \exists f\in F \mbox{ st } y = f(x)\}
\end{aligned}
$$

My teacher said in class $A(x) = C(x)$. But I am not sure of this... I think $A(x) = B(x)$. 


**Question:** Are all this sets equal? 

- If yes, why? There is no difference between "for some", "for all", "existance" in this case? Why not?

- If not, what are the differences between those sets?

Out of your curiosity, I've seen this in the context of groups actions, where, $F$ is a group acting on $X$, and $A(x)$ is defined as the orbit of $x$.
