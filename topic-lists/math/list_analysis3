Real Topology
	- Intervals
		- Def: The set [a, b].
		- Def: The set (a, b).
		- Def: The set [a, b) and (a, b].
		- Def: The set [a, inf), (-inf, b].
		- Def: The set (a, inf), (-inf, b).
	- Interior points
		- Formal Definition: Interior points.
		- Formal Definition: Interiot set of a set.
		- Equivalent: If a\in A is interior, there a1,a2 st a\in (a1, a2) subset of A.
		- Intuition: if a is interior point, a vicinity of it is inside A.
		- Theorem: int(A) is subset of A.
		- Eg: Calc: int({x1, ..., xn}) = empty_set.
		- Eg: Calc: int(a, b) = (a, b).
		- Eg: Calc: int[a, b] = (a, b).
	- Open Set
		- Formal Definition: A is open iff int(A) = A.
		- Theorem: If A1 and A2 are open ==> A1 inter A2 is open.
		- Theorem: If A1 and A2 are open ==> A1 union A2 is open.
		- Theorem: int(A inter B) = int(A) inter int(B)
		- Theorem: int(A union B) = int(A) union int(B).
		- Corolary: Intersection of finite open sets are open
		- Corolary: Union of finite open sets are open.
		- Note: Intersection of infinite open sets might not be open. 
		- Eg.: {0} = Inter (-1/n, 1/n) for all n\in N. To use arquimedean property.
		- Eg.: [a,b] = Inter (a-1/n, b+1/n).
