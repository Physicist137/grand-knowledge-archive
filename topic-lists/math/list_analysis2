Formal Definition of Sequences
	- Sequences
		- Formal Definition: Function f: N --> R.
		- nth term of the sequence.
		- Note: Function need not to be injective
		- Def: The set x(N) of all numbers of the sequence. (It may be a finite set ofc).
	- Some definitions
		- Def: Monotonic Sequences
		- Def: Increasing sequence. Decreasing sequence.
		- Def: Non-Decreasing sequence. Non-Increasing sequence.
		- Def: Bounded frmo above. Bounded from below (limitada superiormente/inferiormente).
		- Def: Bounded sequence: Ie, Bounded from above and from below. Equivalently, |xn| <= C, all n.
		- Def: Non Bounded sequence.
		- Def: Subsequence of a sequence.
		- Question: Can sequence be non-increasing and non-decreasing simultaneously?
	- Some trivial properties
		- Note: All non-decreasing sequences are bounded from below.
		- Note: All incerasing/decreasing/nondecreasing/nonincreasing sequences are monotonic.
		- Note: If subsequence of monotonic sequence xn is bounded (from above/below) ==> xn is bounded (from above/below)
	- Examples of sequence
		- Eg: The constant sequence (say xn=1). Note: Its monotonic, non-decreasing, non-increasing.
		- Eg: xn = n. Note: Its bounded from below. Unbounded from above. Its monotonic increasing.
		- Eg: Alternating sequence (1, 0, 1, 0, ...). Note: Bounded.
		- Eg: Harmonic sequence (xn = 1/n). Note: Monotonic decreasing, bounded.
		- Eg: (1, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0, 7, 0, ...). Bounded from below. Non monotonic.
		- Eg: Power sequence (xn = a^n).
	- Some exercises:
		- Eg: xn = (1 + 1/n)^n. Show: Its bounded from below and above. Its monotonic.
		- Eg: xn = nsqrt(n). Show: Its bounded from below and above. Its monotonic.
		- Eg: xn = 1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + ... + 1/n!. Show: Its monotonic. Its bounded from below and above.



Limit of a Sequence
	- Formal Definition
		- Write: Lim xn = a (as n->inf ofc).
		- Say: Sequence converges to a.
		- The definition (epsilon-delta).
		- Intution to the definition of limit
		- Note: If lim xn = a, any interval (a-e, a+e) will have all x(N), except finite number of n indexes.
	- Simple properties of the limit
		- Theorem: The limit is unique: If lim xn = a  and  lim xn = b, then a = b.
		- Theorem: If sequence converges to a limit, then every subsequence also converges to this limit.
		- Corolary: If sequence converges to a limit, the sequence x_{n+k}, fixed k, converges to same limit.
		- Theorem: Every convergent sequence is bounded. (Note: Reciprocal isn't true. Example of this?)
		- Theorem: Every monotonic bounded sequence is convergent. (Note: What if its non-increasing?)
		- Corolary: If monotonic sequence (xn) has convergent subsequence, then (xn) is convergent.
		- Eg.: Calculate limit (if exists) of: xn = n. xn = 1/n. Alternating sequence. Power Sequence.
	- Arithmetic properties of limits
		- Theorem: If lim xn = 0, and (yn) is bounded sequence, then lim xn yn = 0 (if even lim yn doesn't exist).
		- Theorem: If lim xn = a  and lim yn = b, then:
			1) lim (xn + yn) = a + b = lim xn + lim yn.
			2) lim (xn * yn) = a * b
			3) If b!= 0, then: lim (xn / yn) = a / b
		- Eg: Compute lim sin(nx)/n, x\in R.
	- Signal Theorems
		- Theorem: If lim xn = a > 0, there exists n0\in N st if n > n0 ==> xn > 0.
		- Corolary: If xn, yn are convergent, if xn <= yn, then lim xn <= yn.
		- Corolary: If xn, yn are convergent, if xn < yn, then lim xn <= yn. (Note: lim didn't replace to <).
		- Corolary: The same thing, but with >= and >.
		- Corolary: If xn <= yn <= zn, and lim xn = lim yn = a, then lim zn = a. (Same thing for <, >, >=).
	- TODO: Examples using these theorems.
	- TODO: Examples involving euler number e.
	- Infinite limit
		- Formal Definition
		- Say: Sequence diverges to +-inf.
		- Writes: lim xn = +-inf.
	- Properties of infinite limits
		- Theorem: If lim xn = inf, and yn is bounded from below, then lim (xn + yn) = inf.
		- Theorem: If lim xn = inf, if there exists c>0 st yn > c, then lim (xn yn) = inf.
		- Theorem: If xn>0. Then: lim xn = 0 <==> lim 1/xn = inf.
		- Theorem: if xn>0, yn>0: If there exist c>0 st xn>c:
			- If lim xn = 0, then: lim xn/yn = inf.
			- If (xn) bounded, lim yn=inf, then lim xn/yn = 0.
		- Note: if lim xn = inf, and lim yn = -inf, one can say nothing about lim (xn + yn).



Cauchy Sequences
	- Formal Definition.
	- Imporatnt Theorems
		- Lema: All Cauchy sequences are bounded.
		- Lema: All If cauchy sequence has subsequence converging to a, then sequence converges to a.
		- Theorem: All real cauchy sequences converges.

Numerical Series
	- Formal Definition
		- Def: Partial Sum sequence
		- Def: Series.
	- Theorem: If sum an is convergent series, then lim an = 0.
	- Note: Reciprocal is false
		- Def: Harmonic series
		- Proof: Harmonic series diverges (limit is inf).
	- Other examples
		- Eg: sum 1/[n(n+1)].
		- Eg: Alternating series: sum (-1)^n
	- Other properties
		- Theorem: Series sum an converges (starting with n=1) <==> Series sum an converges (starting with n=n0)
		- Theorem: If an>=0, Series sum an converges <==> partial sum sequence is bounded.
	- Absolute convergence.
		- Def: Absolute convergent series.
		- Eg: Geometrical series.
		- Theorem: Every absolutely convergent series are convergent (note: Reciprocal isn't true! Example?)
