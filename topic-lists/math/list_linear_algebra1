Vector Spaces
	- Formal Definition: Vector space over Field.
		- Vector space: Pair (F,V), where V is group.
		- Definitions
			- Def: Vectors: Elements of the vector Space.
			- Def: Scalar: Elements of field.
		- Structure
			- Scalars form a field under addition and multiplication.
			- Vectors form abelian group under addition
		- Vector-Scalar operations
			- Associativity under multiplication (ab)v = a(bv).
			- Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to vector addition
			- Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to field addition.
	- Examples of Vector spaces
		- R over R.
		- C over R.
		- C over C. Is it different from C over R?
		- F^n is vector space over F.
		- M(m x n, F).The space of mxn matrix over field F
		- F[x]. Polynomials under field F.
	- Main propositions
		- Proposition: If c is scalar, and 0 a vector, then c*0 = 0.
		- Proposition: If c is scalar, and v a vector and c*v = 0 ==> c = 0 or v = 0
		- Proposition: If v is vector, then -v = (-1)v.
	- Vector subspace of V
		- Formal Definition
		- Proposition: W is subspace of V, iff:
			- Null vector is in W.
			- Vector Sum is closed under W
			- Scalar-Vector multiplication is closed under W.
		- Note: V is largest subspace of V. {0} is smallest subspace of V.
		- Example: Verify if they are vector spaces
			- W' = {(x1..xn), x1 = 1 + x2, x1,..xn in F.}. Is subsbace.
			- W' = {(x1..xn), x1 = 0, x1,..xn in F.}. Is not subspace.
			- W' = {A is in M(n, R) : A is symmetric}. Is subspace.
			- W' = {A is in M(n, C) : A is symmetric}. Is not subspace.
			- W' = {A is in M(n, C) : A is hermitian}. Is subspace.
		- Theorem: Non-Empty subset W of V is subsapce iff: v,w in W, c in F ==> cv + w is in W.
	- Generation of vector spaces
		- Def: Linear Combination.
		- Theorem: Intersection of arbitrary collection of subspaces of V is subspace of V.
		- Def: Generated subspace by S over V.
			- Interseção de todos os subspaços de V que contem S.
			- Note: If S is finite, then we say subspace generated by vectors in S.
		- Theorem: Generated subspace by non-empty finite S of V is set of all linear combinations of vectors of S.
