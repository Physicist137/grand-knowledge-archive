Equilibrium, Effect on equilibrium constant when: multiply equation by number, sum with other equilibrium equation. Equilibrium constantes is a DIMENSIONLESS NUMBER. Reaction quotient.
Acid-Base, Strong Acids, Weak Acids. Salts coming from weak acids/bases and strong bases/acids. Plotting pH.
General Formula for arbitrary inital concentrations. Plotting pH. Analyse it and infer buffer systems. Buffers. Hendersonâ€“Hasselbalch equation. Half-Equivalent point (pH = pKa).
Titrations. Experimental Set up. Titrant.
Titration calculations. Finding unknown concentration. Points of a titration: End point, Equivalence point, Half-Equivalence. Analyse first/second derivatives in these points.
Titration curves (pH vs Con) (strong/weak or weak/strong acid/base) - Identify buffer regions, crossovers, etc. Acid-Base indicators to get quantitative data in tritation.
Titration weak/weak acid/base. Titration curve. Arbitrary titration curve (pH vs Concentration). Analysis of the several variables.
Solubility. Dissolution equilibrium equation: Rate of dissolution = Rate of precipitation. Solubility product constant (equilibrium constant). Solubility. Precipitation reactions.
Effect on solubility by adding weak acids/bases. By adding strong acid/bases.
Complex Ion Formation. Equilibrium Equation. Formation constant.
Redox Reactions. Titration of redox reactions. KMnO4.
