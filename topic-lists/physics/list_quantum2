		- Calc: Angular momentum and linear momentum commutator: [Li, pj].
		- Calc: Angular momentum and position commutator: [Li, rj].
		- Note: Lz and z commutes. Lz and pz commutes. But, pz and z does not commute!
		- Note: No component of the angular momentum commutes.
	- Square Total angular momentum operator
		- Formal Definition: L^2.
		- Commutator relations: [L^2, Li]. (also, to write in vector component [L^2, L]).
		- Note: L^2 is compatible with each component of angular momentum operator.
		- Note: L^2 commutes with all angular momentum components.
	- Angular Momentum Ladder operator
		- Assume: L^2 and Lz satisfies eigenstate relations with given function f.
		- Define: L+- = Lx +- iLy.
		- Calc: Comutation relations [Lx, L+-], [Ly, L+-], [Lz, L+-].
		- Note: L+- comutes with L^2 (obviously).
		- Proof: (L+-)f is eigenfunction of L^2 with same eigenvalue.
		- Proof: (L+-)f is eigenfunction of Lz with eigenvalue increased by +-hbar.
		- Note: L+- increases or decreases eigenvalue by hbar.

Angular Momentum Eigenfunctions
	- TODO: Separation of variables
	- TODO: Solve for phi. Show orthogonality of the solution. To note m must be only integer (so solutions are physically acceptable).
	- TODO: Come up with equation only for theta.
	- TODO: Simplify m=0. Substitution x=cos(theta). Power series. Solve. Realize convergence is if |x|<1. 
	- TODO: Truncation to allow x=1 too! (so that solutions will be physically acceptable). Then k=l(l+1), l integer. Polynomial Solution.

	- Limiting value of z-component angular momentum
		- Note: Since L^2 has eigenvalue specified, Lz eigenvalue must have a limit
		- Calc: Force the limit: L+ ft = 0, where ft is top/superior limit. Assume L^2 and Lz eigenvalues for this.
		- Calc: L+- L-+. In function also of L^2. Isolate L^2.

		- Calc: Sameway, calculate eigenvalue of L^2 for the inferior limiting eigenfunction for z-component angular momentum.
		- Calc: L^2 inferior and superior eigenfunctions must be identical. Ofc. Compute it.
		- Note: Given l, then m will go from -l to l, by the ladder operator.
		- Note: Algebraically: l isn't specified. Neither does m. (Can be integer, real, complex, etc).
		- Note: However, algebraically: m ranges -l to l in integer steps ==> l is integer or half integer ==> m is integer or half integer.
		- Note: However, analytically: as we saw, lm must be integer only, for acceptable physical solutions.
		- Note: There exists 2l+1 possible different values of m.
	- Angular momentum allowed values
		- Draw: Diagram indicating Lz and L^2, and the vector draw of L.

		- Note: z-component of angular momentum NEVER reachs its maximum. Odd isn't it?
		- Question: Isn't it wrong? Why can't you rotate your axis, st now z-component is in maximum?
	- Eigenvalues of ladder operators
