Magnetic Ressonance
	- Experimental Set up
		- Set-Up: Spin-1/2 particle at rest in static strong magnetic field
		- Set-Up: Turn on an perturbative RF Field transversal to static magnetic field of some frequency.
	- Assumptions
		- Assumption: RF Field has faar larger wavelength of the system (no need to treat it as a wave).
		- Assumption: RF Field treated as simply EM static oscilative field.
		- Note: Electric parts of RF field does not concern us (title is magnetic ressonance after all!)
		- Note: Spin-1/2 will precess around static magnetic field with a larmour frequency (Larmour Precession).
		- Note: Transversal RF Field might induce spin transition.
	- Magnetic Ressonance
		- The magnetic Field.
		- Calc: The total hamiltonian of the system
		- Calc: The hamiltonian matrix
			- Calc: In function of the pauli spin matrices
			- Calc: The 2x2 hamiltonian (of the time-dependent part).
			- Calc: The 2x2 hamiltonian (of the static magnetic field) (notice some complex exponentials!)
			- Calc: The total hamitlonian matrix (all parts).
		- Calc: The time-dependent schrodinger Equation (matrix form).
		- Calc: Two-Coupled Linear First order ODE.
		- Calc: Uncouple both terms of the ODE (Second linear ODE).
		- Calc: General Solution for an initial spin state (a_0  b_0).
		- Note: The Flopping Frequency.
		- Note: Transition frequency is the larmour frequency.
		- Note: Minimum floppping frequency is a "larmour frequency" associated to the RF field.
	- Transition from spin-up to spin-down.
		- Assume: Measurement is made and the particle is initially in spin up (or down) state.
		- Assume: Immediately after, the RF field is turned on.
		- Calc: Coeficients a particle initially in spin-up state.
		- Calc: The transition probability from spin up to spin down state (initially at up).
		- Calc: The maximum transition probability. The time where there is maximum transition probability.
		- Calc: The ressonance curve for a quantum transition from spin-up to spin-down state.
		- Calc: The ressonance frequency
		- Plot: The ressonance curve
		- Calc: Full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the ressonance curve.
		- Calc: The "quality factor" of the ressonance curve.
		- Note: The ressonance frequency is precisily the larmour frequency (interesting isn't it?)
	- Transition from spin-down to spin-up
		- Calc: Coeficients of a particle initially in spin-down state
		- Calc: The transition probability from spin up to spin down state (initially at up).
		- Calc: The maximum transition probability. The time where there is maximum transition probability.
		- Calc: The ressonance curve for a quantum transition from spin-up to spin-down state.

	- Measuring the g-factor of a proton
		- Set-Up: A proton is at rest, with external field of 1T (Don't ask me how one suceeded in doing this).
		- Set-Up: An 400MHz RF Field where magnetic peaks at 1 micro tesla.
		- Set-Up: The static field is slowly changed, until ressonance is found at 0.23T.
		- Calc: The proton gyromagnetic ratio.
		- Calc: The proton g-factor.
