	- Pre-requisiives: None.
	- Co-requisitive: None.


WARNING: This is HIGHLY discouraged if you plan to learn physics.



OBJECTIVE: How physics is constructed. Validity of equations.
TODO: Classical Mechanics (galileu, planetary orbits, newton's law of gravity, newton's law).
TODO: Electromagnetism (Greeks, Faraday experiments, Maxwell equations, EM Waves).
TODO: Special Relativity. Relativistic corrections to mechanics and EM (to physics). (Aether, Lorentz Transformations, Einstein).
TODO: Quantum Mechanics. Quantum corrections to mechanics and EM (to physics). First Quantization. (Planck E=hf, photoelectric, etc).
TODO: General Relativity. General relativistic corrections to physics (EM fields, mechanics).
TODO: Quantum Field Theory. Quantum corrections to relativistic and non-relativistic fields. Second Quantization. QED.
TODO: Electroweak theory. Quantum chromodynamics. The Standard Model of Physics.
TODO: Quantum Gravity. LQG.
TODO: Theory of Everything. (String Theory, etc).
