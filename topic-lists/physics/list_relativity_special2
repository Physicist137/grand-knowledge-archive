Relativistic Space Time Diagram.
	- The axioms.
		- (1) Principle of relativity. No experiment can measure absolule velocity.
		- (2) Universality of speed of light. All experiments in all inertial frames will agree into the same speed of light.
		- Note: Axiom (1) + universality of time forms galilean relativity.
		- Note: Axiom (1) and (2) forms Einstein's relativity.
	- Space Time Diagrams.
		- (x, t), (ct, x), (t, x/c).
		- Note: A light path ALWAYS has an angle of 45 degree in every frame.
	- Construction of the space time diagrams.
		- Experimental Set up.
			- O bar is stationary.
			- Event E: Emission of a lightray from c tbar = -a.
			- Event P: Lightray is reflected at xbar=a.
			- Event R: Lightray is received at c tbar = a.
			- Drawing of space time diagram of observer O bar.
			- Objective: What does O bar frame looks like from O frame>
		- The O-Frame spacetime diagram.
			- Assume: O-bar is moving from O-frame at a speed v.
			- Draw: The tbar axis (that is, all points where xbar=0)
			- Draw: The points c tbar=-a, and c tbar=a.
			- Draw: The path of emitted lightray. Extrapolate.
			- Draw: The path of received lightray. Extrapolate.
			- Draw: The x-bar axis of O-bar.
			- Note: X-bar is no longer parallel with x-frame, as with galilean.
		- Angles.
			- Calc: Angle between t-bar and t-frame.
			- Calc: Angle between the x-bar and x-frame.
			- Note: The angles are the same.
	- TODO: Einstein syncronization procedure.
	- The geometry of simultaneity.
		- Simultaneity in galilean spacetime.
		- Simultaneity in relativistic spacetime.
	- Invariant interval.
		- Linear Quadratic Function.
		- Coeficients of the linear transformation.
		- Invariance of the interval.
		- Note: Time and spaces are differentiated by the sign.
		- Note: Easy generalization for more time or more space coordinates.
	- Consequences of the invariant interval.
		- Calc: Time dilation formula. Proper time.
		- Calc: Length contraction formula. Proper length.
	- Sign notation
		- (-+++)-sign notation of the invariant interval.
		- (---+)-sign notation of the invariant interval.
	- Invariant Hyperbolae
		- TODO.
	- Lorentz Transformations.
		- Linear transformation.
		- t-bar and x-bar axis.
		- Putting light-ray events. Scaling of the usual galilean ones.
		- Using invariance of time interval. 
		- Lorentz Transformations.
	- Consequences of Lorentz Transformations.
		- Calc: Derivation of time dilation formula.
		- Calc: Derivation of length contraction formula.
		- Calc: Derivation of Einstein's velocity addition formula.
	- Events in a spacetime diagram.
		- Def: Spacelike event. Events unreachable by observer. Def in terms of interval sign.
		- Def: Timelike event. Events reachable by observer. Def in terms of interval sign.
		- Def: Lightlike event. Events reachable by light. Def in terms of interval sign.
	- Causality in the spacetime.
		- Def: The lightcone.
		- Def: The future region.
		- Def: The now/present region.
		- Def: The past region.
		- Def: The elsewhere region.
		- Note: In galilean, now-region was a line. In relativity, now-region is a single unique point, the event itself.
		- Note: In galilean, there's only past/now/future. In relativity, there's past/now/future/elsewhere.
		- Note: Two observers might disagree with what is past, and what is future, and what is now.
