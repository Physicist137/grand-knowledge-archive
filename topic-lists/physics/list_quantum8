The Measurement Problem
	- Questions
		- What is a measurement?
		- What happens at a measurement?
		- Recall: Theory: Measurement is the application of hermitian operator into quantum state.
		- Recall: Measured value is one of its eigenvalues.
	- The physicists position
		- Realist Viewpoint: The particle has always had the property that we masured.
		- Orthodox Viewpoint: Measurement forces system to take a stand. Creating attribute was not there previously.
		- Agnostic Viewpoint: Its metaphysics. Can't be proven which. Lets ignore it.
	- Spin state (spin up and spin down).
		- Assume: Measurement of Sz of an unknown quantum system yields hbar/2 (measured spin up).
		- Realistic Viewpoint: The spin has always been spin up. Hence why you measured it.
		- Orthodox Viewpoint: Measurement has forced the system to decide to be in spin up.
		- Agnostic Viewpoint: Why do we care? The theory is OK with experiment. Lets move on!
	- The Realist Viewpoint.
		- QM is incomplete. Only gives probability.
		- Hidden variable Theory.
	- Orthodox Viewpoint.
		- Wavefunction becomes known after measurement.
		- Def: Collapse of the wavefunction
		- Wavefunction becomes an specific eigenstate (or eigen-vector-space in case of degenerate eigenvalue).
		- Note: TISE and TDSE are deterministic equations. QM is deterministic. However:
		- Note: Measurement makes time evolution non-deterministic. (Hence our theory is non-deterministic).
		- Problem: Why do the nature care if we peak?


EPR Paradox
	- Named: Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Paradox.
	- There is also: EPRB: Version of EPR made by David Bohm.
	- Pi Meson decay
		- Neutron Pi Meson: No charge, no spin.
		- Decays into: An electron and a position (charged, and spin-1/2).
		- Center of mass frame: Pi meson in rest. Electron-positon pair goes to opposite directions.
	- The spin state of the system
		- Pi meson has spin zero.
		- Conservation of spin: Electron-positron pair must have total spin zero.
		- Conclusion: Electron-Positron pair are in the singlet state
		- And wait a second.. they go into opposite directions!
	- Spin detectors for the electron and positon pair (say.. Stern-Gerlach Machines)
		- At first: Spin detectors might not be aligned.
		- Assume: Spin detectors measuring parallel spin direction
		- Then: If electron is measured in spin up, then positron must be measured in spin down.
		- Then: If positron is measured in spin down, then electron must be measured in spin up.
		- Experiment: Full agreement with experiment.
	- Problems with the Orthodox View
		- If the measurement *causes* the collapse, then they will decide states upon first measurement.
		- What if: Separating the experiments far apart.
			- Assume: No superluminar travel (the collapse takes time to arrive) (locality).
			- Then: When electron is measured, there is no time (speed of light) to transmit that info to fellow positron.
			- Then: One should measure sometimes both in spin up, or maybe both in spin down. (Violation of conservation of angular momentum).
			- This is NOT in experimental agreement.
		- Orthodox View in trouble.
	- Locality and causality.
		- Def: Locality.
		- Def: Causality.
		- If Orthodox view: Then there is Locality XOR causality.
		- Note: One cannot have both locality nor both causality.
		- Note: Relativity is already well established!
		- Note: As you know, superluminal signals implies time travel possibility.
	- Relativistic Frames of Reference
		- In different frames, detectors can measure first.
		- Frame A: Electron is detected with spin up before positron is measured.
		- Frame B: Positron is detected with spin down before electron is measured.
		- Orthodox View cleary in trouble
	- Conclusion
		- By view of the EPRB paradox, Orthodox view is very wrong.


Bell's Theorem and Bell's Inequalities
	- Observation of many pi-meson decays.
		- Note: Either electron is measured in spin up or spin down.
		- Note: Either positron is measured in spin up or spin down.
		- Note: Data table with the values of spin (in units of hbar/2 ofc).
		- Note: Evaluation of the product of the measured spins.
	- Average of the product of the spins
		- Calc: Average of the products of parallel detectors
		- Calc: Average of the products of antiparallel detectors
		- Calc: Average of the products of detectors in orientations a, b.
	- Bell's Inequalities
		- Assume: A hidden variable theory with hidden variable lambda.
		- Note: Lambda can vary at will with one pion decay to the other. We do not control it.
		- There exists A(a, lambda) function giving electron measurement. B(b, lambda) for positron.
		- Note: Experiment indicates: A, B can only takes +1 or -1.
		- Note: Aligned/Parallel detectors ==> Results perfectly anti-correlated (A = -B).
		- Calc: Average of the product of the measurement. (assumption of a hidden variable density distribution).
		- Calc: Writing average with only in terms of A.
		- Calc: P(a, b) - P(a, c).
		- Calc: Bell's Inequalities.
	- Bell's Theorem
		- Inequality relating ANY local hidden variable to the averages.
		- Assume: a,b orthogonal, c,a makes 45degree. c,b makes ofc 45 degree.
		- Calc: Bell's Inequalities for that special case.
		- Calc: Quantum prediction for the average of products.
		- Note: They are incompatible.
		- THE THEOREM: All local hidden variables theories are INCOMPATIBLE with quantum mechanics.
	- Conclusion of bell's Theorem:
		- Either hidden variable is correct, or quantum mechanics is correct
		- Note: Realistic and and orthodox views are rather correct or not.
		- Note: Agnostic view is no longer acceptable
		- Note: Bell provided experimental set up for answering that question
	- Experiments of Bell's Inequalities
		- Full agreement with QM.
		- ERRRRR................................ How can that be?
	- Conclusions of Bell's Experiment
		- Experimental Conclusion: Nature is fundamentally non-local: Wavefunction superluminal collapse.
		- Experimental Conclusion: Orthodox View is experimentally correct.
		- Note: Collapse of entangled system leads to no superluminal information propagation
		- Note: Despites nonlocal, collapse is not noncausal. (AT LEAST!! WHAT IF NOT? WOULD BE A DISASTER!)
		- Question: Can I transmit information by means of state collapse?
		- The core of why this happens: The positron and electrons spins are said to be "entangled"


Quantum Entanglment
	- Two Level System
		- Recall: A quantum system will be in linear combination of two levels
		- Recall: Both levels are orthonormal.
		- Assume: Two quantum particles in a two-level system.
		- Combined quantum state: Tensor product of the states.
		- Calc: The combined quantum state
	- Two-Particle Entangled State
		- Formal Definition: Cannot be expressed as tensor product of two one-particle states.
		- Note: Hence, we cannot talk about state of each particle.
		- Theorem: alpha|ab> + beta|ba> cannot be expressed as |psi(a)>|psi(b)>, for any one-particle state
		- Note: A quantum system in state alpha|ab> + beta|ba> is said to be "entangled" (both particles are entangled).
	- Examples of Entanglet States
		- The Singlet State
		- The Bell State
	- Comunication via entanglment
		- Question: Can one comunicate via entanglment?
		- Note: Entaglment collapse is superluminal. Superluminal comunication!
		- Relativity: could be used to sent signals to the past!
		- Question: Can one comunicate via entanglment?
	- I CAN! Consider:
		- Assume: Entangled quantum system (say.. something in bell state) (or kaon decay electron-positron pair).
		- Assume: We give the two particles, to Alice and Bob. (Say..: Alice gets the electron, Bob gets the positron).
		- Note: It is nice to notice the electron and the positron lifetimes are infinite. [smile].
		- If Alice wants to transmit "yes" superluminally to Bob, Alice measures the electron spin.
		- If Alice wants to transmit "no" superluminally to Bob, Alice won't measure the electron spin.
		- Bob End: Produce a copy of positron state to several other positrons. Measure them up!
		- Note: An "yes" or "no" has been transmitted, superluminally, via quantum entanglment. WHAAAAT?
	- TODO: No Cloning Theorem



Measurement: Collapse of a Quantum State
	- Yes.. What is a measurement?
	- Note: Measurement causes nonlocal collapse of the quantum state. It is thus important to know what exactly is a measure..
	- Schrodinger's Cat
		- Assume: Radioactive portion is inserted into box. Decay happens very slow.
		- Assume: If photodetectors detects decay, then brokes a container of poison and cat dies.
		- After an hour.. how is the cat? Quantum Prediction: Its in a superposition between alive and dead.
		- If we measure... (open the box), we will collapse the wavefunction, and known in which state the cat will be.
		- This is NONSENSE, Schrodinger Argued. Evidently cat is either dead or alive (realist view (already proven wrong!)).
		- "I don’t like it (quantum mechanics) and I’m sorry I ever had anything to do with it. [flip to biology]" - Erwin Schrodinger.
	- Effects on measurement in a transition
		- Recall: Transition probability is proportional to t (since transition rate is constant).
		- Calc: Probability system has not decayed (its in upper state) after a time t.
		- Calc: Probability system has not decayed (its in upper state) after a time 2t.
		- Note: Measuring the syste, collapses the wavefunction, and process restarts all over again.
		- Calc: Probability system has not decayed after a measure in t, and a measure in 2t (ie, t and later t).
		- Note: Its approximately the same.
	- Effects on fast measurement in a transition
		- Recall: Probability of transition of incoherent perturbation of a frequence distribution of EM energy density.
		- Note: The result of dependence proportional t comes because we assume integral is peaked.
		- Note: At very small time, this doesn't happen.
		- Calc: Expansion for sin^2.
		- Calc: Probability of a transition for veery fast t. (Note: Its quadratic).
		- Calc: Probability system is measured in upper state (not decayed) after time t.
		- Calc: Probability system is measured in upper state (not decayed) after time 2t.
		- Calc: Probability system is measured in upper state (not decayed) after measurement in time t and 2t.
		- Note: The act of measurement changed the transition probability.
		- Calc: Probability of measuring system in upper state after n equally spaced at time-t measurements.
		- Calc: What if n->inf? What happens then?
	- Quantum Zeno Effect
		- Also called: Watched Pot Phenomenon! (not much to do with zeno..).
		- Watched Pot Phenomenon: A watched pot never boils! And a watched particle never decays!!
		- Question: What is continuous observations?
		- Question: Is a cloud chamber continuous observations?
		- Note: Particle do decay in a clould chamber.
		- Zeno Paradox Experiments.
	- Conclusion
		- Er... Is there one? We seems to have clouded even more what is a measurement.
		- Question: What is a measurement?
		- Question: What is the mechanism of collapse of a quantum state?
		- Note: These are open problems.



Quantum Mechanics Axioms
	- Finally!
		- Finally, we can now have the axioms of QM, and finally, start to build a theory for it.
		- Yep! You heard right there. I said **start** to build a theory of Quantum Mechanics.
		- This starts in list: Formal Quantum Mechanics 01.
	- Sketch of the axioms of Quantum Mechanics
		- Measurement is application of hermitian operator. (We already knew).
		- Measured value is its eigenvalue. (We already knew).
		- Measurement collapses the quantum state to an eigenstate (This one is new!)
	- Question: How to deal with the wavefunction per say?
	- Question: How to deal with probability density?
	- Question: How to unify wavefunction and spin? They are both QM after all..
