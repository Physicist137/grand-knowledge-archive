Before 1500[edit]
3rd century BC - Aristarchus of Samos proposes heliocentric model, measures the distance to the Moon and its size


1500s[edit]
1543 – Nicolaus Copernicus places the Sun at the gravitational center, starting a revolution in science
1583 – Galileo Galilei induces the period relationship of a pendulum from observation (according to later biographer).
1586 - Simon Stevin demonstrates that two objects of different mass accelerate at the same rate when dropped.
1589 – Galileo Galilei describes a hydrostatic balance for measuring specific gravity.
1590 – Galileo Galilei formulates modified Aristotelean theory of motion (later retracted) based on density rather than weight of objects.


1600s[edit]
1602 – Galileo Galilei conducts experiments on pendulum motion.
1604 – Galileo Galilei conducts experiments with inclined planes and induces the law of falling objects.
1607 – Galileo Galilei arrives a mathematical formulation of the law of falling objects based on his earlier experiments.
1608 – Galileo Galilei discovers the parabolic arc of projectiles through experiment.
1609 - Johannes Kepler describes to motion of planets around the Sun, now known as Kepler's laws of planetary motion.
1640 – Ismaël Bullialdus suggests an inverse-square gravitational force law.
1665 – Newton introduces an inverse-square law of gravitation uniting terrestrial and celestial theories of motion and uses it to predict the orbit of the Moon and the parabolic arc of projectiles.
1684 – Isaac Newton proves that planets moving under an inverse-square force law will obey Kepler's laws
1686 – Isaac Newton uses a fixed length pendulum with weights of varying composition to test the weak equivalence principle to 1 part in 1000


1700s[edit]
1798 – Henry Cavendish measures the force of gravity between two masses, leading to the first accurate value for the gravitational constant


1800s[edit]
1846 – Urbain Le Verrier and John Couch Adams, studying Uranus orbit, independently prove that another, farther planet must exist. Neptune was found at the predicted moment and position.
1855 – Le Verrier observes a 35 arcsecond per century excess precession of Mercury's orbit and attributes it to another planet, inside Mercury's orbit. The planet was never found. See Vulcan.
1876 – William Kingdon Clifford suggests that the motion of matter may be due to changes in the geometry of space
1882 – Simon Newcomb observes a 43 arcsecond per century excess precession of Mercury's orbit
1887 – Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley in their experiment do not detect the ether drift
1889 – Loránd Eötvös uses a torsion balance to test the weak equivalence principle to 1 part in one billion
1893 – Ernst Mach states Mach's principle; first constructive attack on the idea of Newtonian absolute space
1898 – Henri Poincaré states that simultaneity is relative
1899 – Hendrik Antoon Lorentz published Lorentz transformations
