	- Pre-requisitives: Calculus 04, Fisica 02, Continuum 01, Thermodynamics 02.
	- Co-requisitives: 


POSSIBLY: When thermodynamics 02 becomes necessary, then its Fluid Dynamics 02. =D.


Fluid in Equilibrium
	- TODO: Definition of a fluid
	- TODO: Stress-Tensor of fluid in equilibrium.
	- TODO: Fluid under gravity (constant density, constant temperature).
	- TODO: Fluid in rotating recipient.
	- TODO: Self-Gravitating Fluid.


Recall: PVT Thermodynamics Review.
	- TODO: General PVT. Heat capacities. Entropy.
	- TODO: Ideal Gas.


TODO: Diffusion. Diffusivities. Mass transport.
TODO: Heat transport. General equation for heat transport. Equation for constant pressure. Variation of entropy (per unit volume) always increases.
TODO: Couette Flow. Laminar Flow. Shear Viscosity. Momentum transport.
TODO: General transport Phenomena. Diffusivity of transported thing. (Diffusivity of matter, heat, momentum).





All I have to do.....:
1) The Makefile generator. (Lets do it! faaast!)

Description of a Fluid
	- Def: The continuum approximation.
	- Definition of a fluid
		- Deformes under tangential forces
		- Resists under normal forces
		- Pressure, Density at point in space and time.
		- The velocity field.
	- The Euler Equation
		- Recall: Force acting on fluid volume (surface integral of pressure)
		- Calc: The force density in a fluid volume (pressure gradient).
		- Calc: The total derivative of the velocity field
		- Calc: The euler equation
		- Calc: Addition of a force field per unit mass in the euler equation (acc).
	- TODO: The Continuity Equation
	- Hydrostatics
		- Fluid in mechanical equlibrium
		- Calc: Euler equation in the hydrostatic regime
		- Calc: Curl on both sides
		- Note: Gradient density is always parallel to the force.
		- Calc: Euler equation with force per unit mass from potential function
		- Example: Calc: Hydrostatic incompressible atmosphere with cte gravity
		- Example: Calc: Hydrostatic ideal-gas isothermal atmosphere with cte gravity
		- Example: Calc: Hydrostatic ideal-gas linear temperature decay atmosphere with cte gravity
