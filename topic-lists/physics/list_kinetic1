DUVS OF A1:
	- 1.10: The internal energy should be N * <E>. If 1.10 is true, would conflict 1.9 by same reason.
	- 1.12: You are actually calculating the variance of the random variable E. The 2-moment of E is calculated wrongly...
	- 3.2: Can it be done in cartesian coordinates? Results I've found wasn't good.
