CAPACITORS (WITH DIELECTRIC INSIDE OFC):
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitance#Simple_systems
	- Calculate: Electric Field, Polarization Density, D-Field.
	- Calculate: Capacitance, Energy Density, Electrostatic Energy stored, pressures and stresses in each conductor, forces (if applies);
	- Calculate: Capacitance per unit length (if applies), Capacitance per unit area (if applies).
	- Type: Two concentric conducting spheres with radii a,b (b>a)
	- Type: (Plane capacitor) Two large flat conducting sheets of area A, separated by distance d.
	- Type: (Coaxial Cable) Two concentric conducting cylinders of length L larged compared with their radii (a,b) (b>a)
		- Note: For fixed capacitance per unit length, and fixed outer-radius of inner conductor, the inner-radius of outer-conductor varies exponentially.
		- Note: A slight chance in desired capacitance might lead to a HUGE change in the inner-radius of outer-conductor. Exploit this numerically.
		- Comparisom between plane capacitor and coaxial cable (if both plane and cylinder are isometric, with d far smaller their radii).
	- Type: (Two-Wire Transmission Line) Two long cylindrical conductors of radii a1, a2, parallel, separated by distance d, large compared with their radius.
