Formal Definitions
	- The Material Body
		- Def: Material Body. Abstract Compact measurable set (infinite size) of material elements.
		- Def: Material particles/points. An element of the material body set.
		- Restriction: There must exist an one-to-one correspondence between the material body and a subset of R3.
	- Configuration of the material Body
		- Def: Configuration: Mapping B --> E3, indicating position occupied by each element of B.
		- Def: Reference configuration (say.. at time t=0).
		- Def: Present configuration (at an time t).
	- Motion of material body
		- Mapping: E3 x R --> E3 from reference confifuration to prevent configuration.
		- Domain: Image of the reference configuration mapping cartesian R (time coordinate).
		- Image: Euclidean Espace E3.
		- Note: Motion must be continuously differentiable in finite regions (or whole body) st motion is invertible.
		- Note: Inverse garanteed by implicit Function Theorem.
		- Drawing of the mappings and sets. Sets: Material Body, Reference Configuration, Present Configuration.
	- Physical Intuition
		- Inversion of such functions: Axiom of continuity.
		- Consequence: Matter is indestructible: Finite volume cannot be deformed to zero/infinite volume.
		- Consequence: Matter is impenetrable. One portion of matter cannot penetrate into other.
		- Note: There exists physical phenomena where this axiom is violated: Cutting, Tearing, Propagation of Cracks, etc.
