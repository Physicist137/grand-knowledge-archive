	- First Law
		- Change of state in adiabatic system yields same amount of work (independent on intermediate steps).
		- Overwhelming experimental evidence: Joule Paddle-wehell experiment, Joule electrical work experiment.
		- Def: State function: Internal energy of the system.
		- Note: Not true for non-thermally insulated systems.
		- Def: Heat supplied to the system: Deficit between increase of internal energy and work.
		- Note: Work/Heat are not state functions. Thus, they do not describe the system.

		- Note: We shall calculate later how much is this boltzmann constant, by applying this to ideal gas.
		- Note: Accessing maximum amount of microstates <==> Maximization of entropy. (Equivalent approaches).
		- Note: This is an absolute entropy definition (it is not relative entropy).
		- Note: Entropy is zero when everyone in the system has no choice but to be in a single unique state.

	- Correction of Gibbs Paradox.
		- Note: Difference in entropy can be approximated as logarithm of factorials of N (that is, N!)
		- Note: If we subtract absolute entropy by logN!, entropic difference yields zero on that case.

"The Chapman-Enskog equation is the link between statistical mechanics and the Navier-Stokes equations that you allude to at the end."






They are derivable from classical mechanics using either the continuum or molecular points of view.

Starting with a continuum view, one applies conservation of mass, momentum, and energy to a control volume and the result is the Navier Stokes equations. The Navier Stokes equations, in the usual form, apply to Newtonian fluids, that is fluids whose stress and rate-of-strain are linearly related. One might regard this as an assumption but it can also be viewed as the first term in a power law expansion.

Starting with a microscopic point of view, one can derive the Navier-Stokes equations from taking moments of the Boltzmann equation. In this approach, the linear relation between stress and rate-of-strain appears naturally as the first term in the Chapman-Enskog expansion.

Many undergraduate fluids textbooks include a derivation from the continuum point of view. The derivation from a molecular point of view is done in first-year graduate textbooks such as Introduction to Physical Gas Dynamics by Vincenti and Kruger.
