TITLE: Algorithms
	- Pre-requisitives: Elementary Algebra
	- Co-requisitives: Pre-Calculus


Basic introduction and Fundamentals
	- What is an algorithm
	- Example: Insertion sort
		- Description
		- Visual representation
		- Pseudo-code
		- C++ code
	- Analysis of Algorithms
		- Objective
			- Two algorithms for same goal..
			- Comparisom of algorithms
			- Which/when/why algorith A is more efficient than B?
		- Variables of the analysis
			- Input size: Example: Sort, Multiply, 
			- Running time: Steps
	- Analysis of the Insert sort
		- Instruction i is executed in time c_i
		- Best Case Scenario
			- Already sorted array
			-  Affine function of input
			- Calc: Parameters of the affine function
		- Worse Case Scenario
			- Reversed sorted array
			- Quadratic function of input
			- Calc: Parameters of quadratic function
		- Average Case Scenario
			- Half-Sorted Away
			- Quadratic function of input
			- Calc: Parameters of quadratic function
			- Note: As bad as worse case scenario
		- Growth order
		- Big-Oh notation
	- Design of algorithms
		- Incremental Approuch
		- Divide-and-conquer approuch
		- Merge Sort Algorithm
